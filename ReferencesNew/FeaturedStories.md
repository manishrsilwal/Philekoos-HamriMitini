# Women's health in Nepal
study more at:[Women’s health in Nepal | Public Radio International](https://www.pri.org/stories/2009-06-09/womens-health-nepal)

Almost a third of Nepal’s population lives on less than a dollar a day, and political turmoil has displaced tens of thousands of people. For Nepalese women, life is particularly difficult. The country has a long record of discrimination and exploitation, and maternal mortality in Nepal has historically been among the highest in Asia. 

Dr. Sangeeta Mishra is trying to change that. She is a gynecologist from Nepal. She has spent much of the past year as a Fulbright Scholar at Johns Hopkins University. On "Here and Now" she talks about how women's health issues are addressed in Nepal.

Dr. Mishra: "These women they are not coming to the clinics, they don't have access to the hospital, so sitting in the clinic and solving the problem [on a] one-on-one basis, it doesn't work for Nepal.

"First thing which I realized was a major problem in Nepal was high rate of maternal mortality, and women were dying due to pregnancy-related complications. Women ... are not aware of pregnancy [complications] ... it's just a normal thing and that they can deliver at home and they are not aware of the consequences that pregnancy can bring.

"So I plan to develop a major educational and awareness generation program for these women, where most of the deaths occur ... to [inform] them of the importance of delivering at the hospital, or having a skilled helper at home."

She says around 68 percent of the women deliver in rural areas, and only 16 percent deliver in hospitals, and that delivering at home is a part of the culture: "In the family, mother-in-laws and mothers believe that, because they didn't have any complications and they delivered at home, so they think that their daughters-in-laws and daughters, they should also deliver at home.

"What these women don't realize is that, they deliver ten kids at home, but how many were alive? Out of ten, you have only four or five kids alive. In this era you cannot deliver ten children and then you have two or three of them alive; you should have two or three kids and all of them should be alive."

The low literacy rate in Nepal is also a barrier when it comes to educating the women about health issues. Dr. Mishra says creating messages to transmit on the radio is a good way to get around the literacy problem, as well as utilizing female community health volunteers who go door-to-door. 

"Here and Now" is an essential midday news magazine for those who want the latest news and expanded conversation on today's hot-button topics: public affairs, foreign policy, science and technology, the arts and more.

# being a girl thing
More:http://beejupoudyal.wordpress.com/
I live in a country where acid is thrown on a school student’s face. May be the reason behind it will be proved as her “being a girl” at the end, And the very next day i got to read a news with title “what to do when someone throws acid” with different medicinal and home made solutions. I wonder why i could not read a news with a title “what you can do not to throw acid to a women’s face”. The entire thinking lead to one conclusion ” Hey school girl!! They will throw acid on you, target will be your face. So learn what to do when someone throws acid on you and walk with the first aid box. Cause the thing “learning” is only you have to do cause you are a “girl”. No one will teach them not to throw acid.”

# Chaupadi, a tradition in Nepal, turns menstruating women into untouchables
read more :https://www.statnews.com/2017/02/17/nepal-tradition-chaupadi-menstruation/ 
Are you on your period?” my grandmother regularly asked during my visits to Nepal as a teenager. She wanted to know because I would be “unclean” if I was menstruating. I felt a mix of guilt and rebellion every time I lied. And I would always lie so I could sleep in my own bed, go into the kitchen if I was hungry, or watch TV with the rest of my family. Divulging the truth meant the four days of isolation that I saw my aunts and cousins endure.

Fortunately, my mother gave me permission to lie. She didn’t want me to suffer like she had as a teenager living in Nepal — cut off from the family, sleeping in the basement, and not being able to go to temple.

This social tradition of monthly isolation is called chaupadi. Menstruating women are thought to offend the Hindu gods and bring down a curse on their households if they remain indoors. In addition to being prohibited from taking part in normal family activities, women who are menstruating are forced to live outside of the home in cow sheds or makeshift huts, regardless of the weather.
