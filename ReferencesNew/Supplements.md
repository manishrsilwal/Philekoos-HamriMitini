 SOMETIMES FOOD IS NOT ENOUGH
The causes of vitamin and mineral deficiencies are multiple, as well as interconnected.

At the most basic level, the problem is related to diet and access to sufficient amounts of nutrient-rich foods. 

When we say "supplements," we're talking about vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other natural products. They are things you take in addition to what you eat -- they supplement your diet. When used right, supplements can help keep your body and mind well in many ways. We'll explain more below.







# Supplements For you
### Skin Health


Healthy fats, such as omega-3 fatty acids, and foods rich in antioxidants can help keep your skin healthy.

 Antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, and selenium speed up skin repair and help prevent sun damage and skin cancer. 
Other supplements that may slow skin aging are:
* Coenzyme Q10
* Green tea
* Soy
* B vitamins
Of course, you should always wear sunscreen, especially if you're using a product with vitamin A on your skin, since that makes it more sun-sensitive.

### Weight Loss 

Losing weight comes down to what you eat and how active you are. Some people also turn to supplements to help, but they won't replace a healthy plan for diet and exercise.


* Green Tea  : Burning more calories and targeting fat.

* Calcium and calcium supplements :  May help curb body fat. 

* Quercetin:  Stimulating nutrients speed up how fast your tissues burn fats and sugars. 

* Caffeine and catechins: May help you feel less hungry.
