Yes, supplements have a lot to offer to help you improve your health and wellness.

When we say "supplements," we're talking about vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other natural products. They are things you take in addition to what you eat -- they supplement your diet. When used right, supplements can help keep your body and mind well in many ways. We'll explain more below.

Even though you can buy supplements without a prescription, you should talk with your doctor about what you're taking because some supplements don't mix well with drugs or certain medical conditions. At each doctor's visit, bring a list of all your prescriptions as well as any over-the-counter medications and supplements you use. Include the dosages and how often you take each one.
